<h3>THE TEN<br />
MOST BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS<br />
<small>IN THE UNITED STATES</small>.</h3>



<p class="p2">During the Autumn of the past year
a voting contest was proposed to the
readers of <span class="smcap">The Brochure Series</span>
with the object of determining by
the consensus of votes, which, in their opinion,
were the Ten Most Beautiful Buildings
now existing in the United States.
The only condition imposed was that no
reader should enter more than one list. A
lively interest was taken in the contest,
and over two hundred votes were received,&mdash;the
voters being almost entirely either
architects or professed students of architecture.</p>

<p>The following ten buildings, named in
the order of preference, are those which
received the greatest number of votes in
this contest; and the appended percentages
show approximately what proportion of the
total number of votes each received:&mdash;</p>

and draws some interesting conclusions
from the comparison of it with a similar
list, compiled fifteen years ago in the same
way by the readers of <i>The American Architect</i>.

<p class="p2">A final and absolute verdict upon the
relative merits of works of art is in
most cases an impossibility. Since
there is no such thing as an absolute
objective standard of comparison for all
works of a given class, the personal equation
and the time equation must always
enter largely into critical estimates by
individuals or groups of individuals. Least
of all are we likely to pass correct judgments
on contemporary works, because we
measure them wholly or mainly by the
dominant taste or fashion of our time,
instead of by that larger experience and
more impartial judgment which comes
with the lapse of decades and centuries.
When, however, a large number of intelligent
and presumably competent critics are
found in agreement as to the merits or
defects of a given work, it is safe to conclude
that there is some ground for the
verdict; and when the agreement extends
to a number of buildings (in the verdict
about to be discussed we are dealing with
buildings) it is reasonable to draw definite
inferences as to the grounds of the agreement,
both in relation to the works so
judged and in relation to the view-point
and taste of those who have pronounced
the opinion.</p>

<p>Of course in such a vote as that by <span class="smcap">The
Brochure</span> readers on the "Ten Most
Beautiful Buildings in the United States,"
the result can only be a composite,&mdash;a
consensus reached by the fusing together
and averaging of a great number of widely
diverse estimates. The very terms of the
vote will be variously interpreted according
as the expression "the most beautiful
building" is made to apply to the exterior
alone, or to the plan, the decorative detail,
the scale, or other elements of architectural
design, or to include all; and according to
the varying values assigned to dignity,
simplicity, richness, grandeur, refinement,
and other qualities, by the several voters.
But, having made all these allowances,
there is much instruction and suggestion in
the vote, both as to the tendencies of
taste among the constituency of <span class="smcap">The
Brochure Series</span>, and as to the progress
and tendencies of American architecture,
especially in the light of the vote of 1885 in
<i>The American Architect</i>.</p>

the "Second" list, and that published in

<p>These percentages are only approximate,

a rough way, that the ten buildings ranking
highest received about 63 per cent of
all the votes, and that the seven in the
Renaissance group obtained 44.5 per cent
of all the votes.</p>

<p>Of the ten buildings in	the "1885" list
but three appear in the "First" list, and
two in the "Second"; so that only five of
the ten buildings adjudged in 1885 to be
the most beautiful in the United States
are included in the <i>twenty</i> given the leading
rank in 1899 by the <span class="smcap">Brochure</span> readers.
Of these twenty, six in the "First" list and
five in the "Second" have been built
since the 1885 vote. Of the remaining
four in the "First" list, three, as we have
seen, figure in that of "1885"; the fourth&mdash;the
New York City Hall&mdash;was not in
1885 considered worthy of a place among
the ten&mdash;a significant suggestion as to
changing tastes since that date.</p>

<p>The first and most obvious conclusion to
be drawn from the above statistics is that
American architects, so far as they are
represented in the <span class="smcap">Brochure</span> vote, have
no hide-bound traditions or ingrained
prejudices as to style. There is in the list
selected by them a preponderance, it is
true, of buildings in the various styles of
the Renaissance and Classic Revival&mdash;seven
out of ten. But the third in the list,
with 96 per cent of unanimity in its favor, is
a Romanesque building, Trinity Church,
Boston. Two others, standing sixth and
eighth, are Gothic,&mdash;Trinity and St. Patrick's
Churches in New York. The remaining
seven, although they may all be included
under a broad extension of the term "Renaissance,"
exhibit wide divergencies of
style. The Capitol at Washington and the
Columbia Library represent two different
phases of the Classic Revival, nearly a century
apart in date; the New York City
Hall, a version of the style of Louis XVI.
The Boston Public Library was avowedly
inspired from the "n√®o-Grec" Biblioth√®que
St. Gen√©vi√®ve of Labrouste, as far
as its fa√ßades are concerned, and yet differs
from that building more than it resembles
it; and although, in the foregoing tables,
both this and the Biltmore mansion are
classified as in the French Renaissance
style, they are really much farther apart
than the classic Capitol and the Louis
Seize City Hall. The Congressional Library
follows Italian rather than French
precedents, and the Madison Square Garden
suggests both Italian and Spanish prototypes.
Evidently our architects are not
bound by allegiance to any one style or
kind of beauty, but are ready to find subjects
for admiration in buildings of the
most diverse character, and to recognize
beauty alike in pointed and round arches,
in domes and in spires, in acanthus leaves
and crockets, in new buildings and in old.
This catholicity of taste is interesting,
and on the whole hopeful, for it suggests
the ability and readiness to appreciate
realities instead of names, style rather
than any particular historic dress, essentials
rather than externals;&mdash;an eclecticism
which recognizes beauty, quality,
excellence, wherever they can be found,
and adopts what is best without regard to
names or categories. And if we consider
the buildings themselves, instead of the
motives of the voters, the same statistics
indicate, as we might expect, a like catholicity
of taste in the designs of recent
American buildings, and&mdash;what is more
to the point&mdash;a conspicuous measure of
success in fusing together and adapting to
modern American needs the multifarious
suggestions of the "historic styles," so
that the results are neither copies nor
patchwork, but consistent, intelligent and
harmonious units.</p>

<p>Taking next the second comparative
table, we find that in the "First" and
"Second" lists taken together, 20 per cent
of the names are those of government or
administrative buildings; 15 per cent are
churches, with the same number of libraries
(three of each, all on the "First" list).
There are two each of museums, club
houses and private residences; and one
each of office buildings, hotels, and amusement
houses. Here again we encounter
the same breadth of judgment as in the
first comparison. The <span class="smcap">Brochure</span> readers,
and presumably our architects generally,
are willing to discover beauty alike in public,
private, religious, and commercial architecture.</p>

<p>It is a significant fact that churches and libraries
constitute 60 per cent of the "First"
list, and that there is but one residence, and
not a single commercial edifice among the
ten buildings it enumerates. Apparently
it is religion and education which inspire
and call forth the highest results in architecture,
rather than the private and commercial
luxury of which we hear so much
in these days. If to these sources of architectural
inspiration we add that of civil
government, it appears that we owe 80 per
cent of the "First" list to government,
religion and education&mdash;the three highest
activities of the community. This is not
merely due to the fact that the architectural
requirements of churches and civic
buildings are such as favor monumental
results; for both in size and cost, and hence
in the opportunity for an ample and
sumptuous architectural treatment, these
are often surpassed by banking and office
buildings, private palaces and rich men's
clubs. The presence of three truly magnificent
public libraries of recent erection
in the "First" list seems to me particularly
encouraging, as a symptom of the
extent to which the wealth of the country
is being devoted to the higher interests of
the people, and at the same time to the
promotion of high art. That this is a correct
symptom, is confirmed by such buildings,
erected or about to be erected, as the
Chicago Library, the magnificent New
York Public Library, the new libraries at
Milwaukee, Providence, Newark, N.J.,
Jersey City, and Washington; by the
Art Museum at Chicago, the Corcoran
Gallery at Washington, the new wing to
the Metropolitan Museum at New York,
the Phebe Hearst competition for the University
of California, and other like enterprises.
The most important architectural
enterprises in New York today are the
Cathedral of St. John the Divine and the
vast palace of the Brooklyn Institute, of
which a new wing is about to be erected.
Evidently our art has not fallen wholly a
prey to commercialism and private luxury.</p>

<p>The geographical distribution of the
buildings chosen is interesting. In 1885
but three out of ten were in New York
City, and Albany stood ahead of Boston.
In the "First" list New York has one-half
of the ten, and in the "First" and
"Second" lists, jointly, nine out of twenty
buildings. Boston and Washington divide
the second place, with two each on the
"First" list. In the two lists together
there are nine cities and towns represented,
of which five are in the northeastern states,
with fourteen out of twenty buildings; one
in the nearer west (Chicago); and three in
the south (if we include Washington
among southern cities). Of course the
fact that New York, Boston and Washington
are old cities, as cities go among us,
counts for much in the way of maturity of
civilization and accumulation of architectural
resources; and it is only natural that
the wealthiest city in the New World
should possess the greatest number of
important buildings. But it is also very
possible that the majority of the <span class="smcap">Brochure</span>
readers are in the northern and
eastern states, and therefore more familiar
with eastern and northern than with southern
and western buildings. Allowing for
this, they may draw their own conclusions
from this table.</p>

<p>If now, we turn to inquire what are the
qualities which have won for these buildings
a place on this list, and to what tendencies,
either of progress or retrogression,
do the votes point, two facts stand out
very clearly. The first is, that each of the
ten buildings, whatever its style or purpose,
represents a conception clearly
thought out, simply and forcibly expressed,
and treated with monumental dignity,
quite irrespectively of the amount or richness
of its decoration. The second is, that
there has in recent years been a notable
advance in all that concerns the interior
decoration of important buildings. In
1877 Trinity Church in Boston stood alone
as an example of really high art in interior
decoration. The three most recent buildings
on the list&mdash;all three by the way,
public libraries&mdash;are conspicuous instances
of the sumptuous and dignified treatment
of interior design, with the help of all the
resources of decorative art; and here
again, other buildings now being erected
or about to be built confirm this conclusion,
that our architects and the public are
beginning to appreciate the importance
both of the interior design of a building
and of the collaboration of all the arts,&mdash;as
for instance, in the new Appellate Court
in New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>Comparing the list of 1899 with that of
1885, the progress of our national architecture
in fourteen years becomes very evident.
The United States Capitol and the
Trinity Churches in New York and Boston
are the only buildings common to both lists.
Six of the buildings on the <span class="smcap">Brochure</span> list
were, in 1885, either incomplete or not yet
begun: these are the Boston, Congressional
and Columbia Libraries, the Madison
Square Garden, St. Patrick's Cathedral and
the Biltmore residence. The Cathedral,
however, wanted only its spires; but its
appearance on the <span class="smcap">Brochure</span> list is
undoubtedly due to the spires more than
any other element in its design. In 1885
Mr. H. H. Richardson was the one bright
and particular star on the architectural
horizon in the United States: one-half of
the "1885" list of buildings were his work.
Only one of these remains on the new
list,&mdash;Trinity Church in Boston, doubtless
on the whole his greatest work. The style
which he made his own, and which was
then at the height of popular favor, borne
on the wave of admiration for the real
strength and originality of his works, has
waned, as all fashions must wane which are
not the result of a spontaneous movement
of taste, but ride into favor on the back
of some passing whim or on the merit of
the achievements of some one person or
coterie. No architectural period can be
truly great that depends upon one man or
set of men for its great works.</p>

<p>It is perhaps not amiss to say a few words
regarding buildings of secondary merit and
of minor importance in cost and size.
These may be as significant criteria of
architectural taste and progress as those
most conspicuous for grandeur and beauty.
It is quite possible for the architectural
energy of one place or period to be concentrated
on a small number of great
works, and for an equal amount of energy
and ability in another place or period to be
expended on a larger number of less important
buildings. The average quality of
our architecture, and the quality of our
ordinary every-day architecture, are perhaps
as important as that of the ten most
beautiful buildings; and the fact that the
west and south have so small a representation
in the <span class="smcap">Brochure</span> lists by no means
argues a corresponding deficiency of good
architecture. Yet after all, when all is
said, the great and noble buildings, the
highest and grandest triumphs of architecture
are the only ones which profoundly
affect the imaginations and kindle the
artistic aspirations of men; and when a
community becomes so pervaded with the
artistic spirit that works of art furnish the
readiest, most natural and complete expression
of its ideals and enthusiasms, great
works will result whenever there are enthusiasms
and ideals worthy of monumental
expression. From this point of view the
Columbian and Omaha Expositions, and
the New York Naval Arch of Triumph&mdash;which,
owing to their transitory and temporary
character, no doubt, have found no
place on the <span class="smcap">Brochure</span> lists&mdash;seem to
me in the highest degree significant and
encouraging. And the public libraries, St.
John's Cathedral and the Phebe Hearst
competition are further evidence in the
same direction.</p>

<p>A word might also be said for certain
buildings which found no place on either
the "First" or "Second" list, but which
competent critics might assign to one or
the other list in preference to some that
appear on them. There is for instance,
Mr. Richardson's Woburn Library, which
some consider his most beautiful work next
to Trinity Church; the new State Capitols
of Minnesota and Rhode Island (the latter
not quite finished); the Treasury Building
and White House at Washington; the
Temple Emmanuel; the Metropolitan Life
Building; Metropolitan Club and Cornelius
Vanderbilt's residence in New York; the
University group at Charlottesville, Va.;
the Omaha Exposition and the Dewey Arch.</p>

<p>But the task assigned me was the discussion
of the <span class="smcap">Brochure</span> lists, not of other
possible lists; and I close with the suggestion
that a vote every ten or every five
years would afford a most valuable and
interesting gauge of the movements of
taste and of the progress of architecture in
the United States.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Capitol at Washington</span> is 751 feet in length
and 121 to 324 feet wide, consisting of a main
edifice of sandstone, painted white, and of two
wings of white marble, and covers an area of 3-1/2 acres.
The site was selected by a French engineer, Peter
Charles L'Enfant in 1791, and the design for the first building&mdash;a
compromise between the plans of Stephen Hallet
and Dr. William Thornton,&mdash;was chosen by competition
in 1792. In 1795 George Hadfield was placed in charge of
the work, and was succeeded in 1798 by James Hoban,
neither of whom made important changes in Thornton's
designs. In 1814 the building consisted of two small wings
connected by a wooden bridge; and in that year the
structure was damaged by fire set by the British. Benjamin
Henry Latrobe, who was appointed in 1803, continued in
charge until 1817, when he resigned, turning over his post
and plans to Charles Bulfinch of Boston,&mdash;the first American-born
architect of the Capitol. Bulfinch completed the
central structure, and crowned it with the original low
dome. In 1828 the old capitol was substantially completed,
and the office of architect abolished. In 1843, it being
necessary to enlarge the former structure, plans were
advertised for, and in 1850 those of T. U. Walter of Philadelphia
were accepted. The additions made the old dome
look insignificant, and Walter designed the present one,
which was completed in 1863. The terraces and the approaches,
begun in 1882, are the work of Edward Clark.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Boston Public Library</span>, begun in 1888, was completed
in 1895. The building is 225 feet long, 227 feet deep,
and 70 feet in height from the sidewalk to the top of the
cornice. The material of which the exterior is constructed
is grayish-white Milford granite. Although the architects
of this building were officially the firm of Messrs. McKim,
Mead &amp; White of New York City, the senior member, Mr.
McKim, was the actual architect.</p>

<p>Charles Follen McKim was born in Pennsylvania in
1847. He studied at the Harvard Scientific School, in a
New York architect's office, and in a Parisian <i>atelier</i> connected
with the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.</p>

<p>William Rutherford Mead was born in Brattleboro, Vt.,
in 1846, and graduated from Amherst College in 1867. For
some years he studied in an architect's office in New York,
and then went to Paris, studying there and elsewhere in
Europe.</p>

<p>Stanford White was born in New York City in 1853.
He grew up in the office of Gambrill &amp; Richardson, and
between 1878 and 1880 studied in Europe. The present
firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White was formed in 1880.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Trinity Church, Boston</span>, Henry Hobson Richardson,
architect, was completed in 1877. It is in the shape of a
Latin Cross with a semi-circular apse added to the eastern
arm. A central tower, 211 feet high, rises from piers at
the crossing of the nave and transepts. The chapel is connected
with the main structure by an open cloister. The
extreme width of the church is 121 feet; the extreme length,
160. The material employed in the body of the structure
is Dedham granite, with brown freestone trimmings, and
it is roofed with red tiles. The porch, shown in the small
view on page 9, was contemplated in Mr. Richardson's
original design, and was added in 1897-8 from his sketches,
by his successors, Messrs. Shepley, Rutan &amp; Coolidge of
Boston.</p>

<p>Henry Hobson Richardson was born in Louisiana in
1838. He was educated at Harvard, and matriculated in
1859, and immediately after his graduation went to Paris to
study architecture. A year later he was admitted to the
Ecole des Beaux-Arts, studying in the <i>atelier</i> of Andr√©.
During the war his father lost his property, and Richardson
was forced to support himself by working as a draughtsman
in the offices of French architects; and it was only in 1865
that he returned, and chose New York as the place in
which to try his fortunes. His first commission, won in
competition for the design of a church in Springfield, Mass.,
came to him only after he had been a year at home, but
this brought other work; and by 1866 he was fairly
launched in professional life. In 1867 he entered partnership
with Charles Gambrill in New York. After the dissolution
of this partnership in 1878, he removed to
Brookline, Mass., and there he remained until his death
in 1886.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Congressional Library, Washington.</span> In 1873
Congress passed a bill inviting plans in competition for the
proposed building, and those of Messrs. John L. Smithmeyer
and Paul J. Peltz, both of Washington, were selected.
But between the years 1874, when they were officially
recognized as architects of the building, and 1886, when
Congress finally appropriated money to begin it, they had
to endure great political pressure, and their plans underwent
many modifications and improvements. Finally in
1886, after a bitter fight, they were installed as architects of
the new building. Before the structure had risen above
the foundations, however, a new act of Congress repealed
all that had previously been legislated about the building,
and put its construction under the sole control of the
chief engineer of the army, General Casey. Mr. Smithmeyer
was discharged as architect, but his partner, the
artistic member of the firm, Mr. Peltz, was retained. In
the spring of 1892, when the structure had reached little
more than half its intended height, Mr. Peltz's connection
with the work ceased; and he was succeeded by Mr.
Edward P. Casey of New York, who continued as architect
of the building until its completion in February, 1897.
The library is 470 feet long and 340 deep, and occupies,
exclusive of approaches, three and three-fourths acres.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Columbia University Library</span> was completed in 1898.
The architects are Messrs. McKim, Mead &amp; White, who
have been referred to above.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trinity Church, New York City</span>, was finished in
1848. Richard Upjohn, its architect, born at Shaftsbury,
Eng., in 1802, was given a common-school education,
and afterwards apprenticed to a builder, and engaged in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>this occupation until 1829, when he emigrated to America,
settling in New Bedford, Mass. Here he pursued his trade
until 1833, when he went to Boston, and made some architectural
drawings for a city court-house. He thereafter
continued the practice of architecture with increasing reputation,
until, in 1839, he was called upon to rebuild Trinity
Church, New York, which work gained him a national
reputation as a church architect.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Madison Square Garden, New York City</span>, McKim,
Meade &amp; White, architects, is 465 feet long and 200 feet
wide, and its walls are 65 feet high. The roof is nearly
flat, but the sky-lines are broken by a colonnade which
rises above the roof at the Madison Square Avenue end,
and extends along either side for 100 feet, by six open
cupolas with semi-spherical domes, which rise above the
colonnade, by two towers at the Fifth Avenue corner, and
by a great square tower which rises from the Twenty-sixth
Street side with its lines unbroken for 249 feet, and then in
a series of open cupolas. Along the Madison Avenue end,
and extending along either side for a distance of 150 feet is
an open arcade, which covers the sidewalk, and the roof of
which rests upon pillars of polished granite and piers of
brick. The top of the arcade is laid out as a promenade.
On the top of the tower is poised a heroic figure of Diana,
332 feet from the sidewalk, designed by St. Gaudens. The
materials of the building are buff brick and terra-cotta. It
was completed in 1890.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York City</span>, was
opened in 1879, although the spires were not finished until
1887. Built of white marble, its main dimensions are:
length 306 feet, breadth, including chapels 120 feet, length
of transepts 140 feet, height of nave 108 feet. The principal
front on Fifth Avenue consists of a gable, 156 feet in
height, flanked by twin spires, 330 feet high. James Renwick,
the architect, was born in New York City in 1818.
At the age of sixteen he graduated from Columbia College,
and, following an inherited taste, entered the engineering
department of the Croton Aqueduct. His training in
architecture was entirely self-acquired. He early manifested
a fondness for the Gothic style, and as there were
then no Gothic buildings of merit in America, his knowledge
of it was derived entirely from books. With such
scanty preparation he designed Grace Church in New
York. Later, Mr. Renwick travelled in Europe, and
became still more impressed with the beauty of Gothic
architecture. In 1858 the corner-stone of St. Patrick's
Cathedral was laid, and it was mainly through this church
that his reputation as an architect was established. It was
his life work; he regarded it as his favorite child, and never
ceased to grieve that his original plan, which contemplated
a central lantern and a chevet, and which would have
covered the entire block between Fifth and Madison Avenues,
had been cut down for reasons of economy. Mr.
Renwick died in 1895.</p>


<p class="p2">"<span class="smcap">Biltmore House</span>," at <span class="smcap">Biltmore, N.C.</span>, the residence
of Mr. George Vanderbilt, was completed in 1897.
Its main general dimensions are, 152 by 373 feet. Indiana
limestone was used in its construction.</p>

<p>Richard M. Hunt, its architect, was born in Brattleboro,
Vt., in 1827. He graduated from the Boston High
School in 1843, and in the same year, having already
chosen his profession, he went to Europe. In 1845 he
entered the <i>atelier</i> of Hector Lefuel in Paris, and for nine
years pursued his studies at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. In
1854 his <i>patron</i> having been put in charge of the new work
on the Louvre, Hunt was appointed inspector, and under
Lefuel designed the Pavillion de la Biblioth√®que. In 1855
he returned to New York, and began his American career,
toward 1870 taking up the class of work by which he is best
known. He died at Newport in 1895.</p>

<p>The third and present <span class="smcap">City Hall of New York City</span>
was projected in 1802, when a premium was publicly offered
for the best design. The award was given to Messrs.
Mangin (a Frenchman) and Macomb,&mdash;architects concerning
whom very little authentic information is obtainable.
It was finished in 1812. The corner-stone of the building
was laid by Mayor Edward Livingstone.</p>

<p>The building consists of a central structure of two
stories and an attic, surmounted by a cupola, and two
wings of two stories each. The architects' original design
provided a pediment for the base of the cupola, showing
the city arms and bas-reliefs. The City Hall, when cross-sectioned,
north and south, resembles the Register office in
Edinburgh, designed by the Brothers Adam. The front
and sides are of white marble, with brown freestone basement.
Freestone was used for the rear because the building
then stood so far out of town that it was thought not worth
while to build it of marble. A broad flight of steps leads
from the south to an Ionic colonnade. The cupola is surmounted
by a statue of Justice.</p>
